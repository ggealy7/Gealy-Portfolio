### Script:
Scroll through the storyboard.   Stop at each visualization and ask: 
What do you think the visualization is trying to show?  
Do you think this is an effective title? 
How might you find a better way to display the data?  
Is there anything that you find confusing? 
Can you tell me if there is visualization that you are uninterested in?

When finished ask:
Who do you think this project is for?
Does the call the action match the overall presentation?
How might you change to call to action?
Is there any information you think could add to the effectiveness of the story?
