# User Research Protocol
### Audience: General Population, Young Adults (18-29 years old)
### Metrics:
Whether readers understand the issues that are affecting mental health
Whether readers are interested in the call to action

### Methods:
Remote interviews
10 min interviews, majority ages 18-29, with a few outside of that age range

### Script:
Scroll through the storyboard.   Stop at each visualization and ask: 
What do you think the visualization is trying to show?  
Do you think this is an effective title? 
How might you find a better way to display the data?  
Is there anything that you find confusing? 
Can you tell me if there is visualization that you are uninterested in?

When finished ask:
Who do you think this project is for?
Does the call the action match the overall presentation?
How might you change to call to action?
Is there any information you think could add to the effectiveness of the story?




# Main User Research Findings
25-Year Old Male Law Student:
 -First Image: Not sure if the timeline is the most effective way to show this information.  Felt it would be effective to use just a snapshot of the last week instead of data for the whole pandemic.  Found the Axis title confusing, he thought % respondents meant the % of people who responded to the overall survey, not those who responded positively to the question. 
 -Second Image: Suggested using stick figures to compare sizes of each group.  Found the coloring confusing "I couldn't tell which color went with which pie piece."  Suggested changing title from "More than 2 in 5" to Nearly 40%.
 - Third Image: Number is too big and should be more integrated with the sentence.
 - Fourth Image: Change the word problem to concern because the visulaization is looking at confidnec not ability.
