# User Research Protocol
### Audience: General Population, Young Adults (18-29 years old)
### Metrics:
Whether readers understand the issues that are affecting mental health
Whether readers are interested in the call to action

### Methods:
Remote interviews
10 min interviews, majority ages 18-29, with a few outside of that age range

### Script:
Scroll through the storyboard.   Stop at each visualization and ask: 
What do you think the visualization is trying to show?  
Do you think this is an effective title? 
How might you find a better way to display the data?  
Is there anything that you find confusing? 
Can you tell me if there is visualization that you are uninterested in?

When finished ask:
Who do you think this project is for?
Does the call the action match the overall presentation?
How might you change to call to action?
Is there any information you think could add to the effectiveness of the story?




# Main User Research Findings
### 25-Year Old Male Law Student:
 -First Image: Not sure if the timeline is the most effective way to show this information.  Felt it would be effective to use just a snapshot of the last week instead of data for the whole pandemic.  Found the Axis title confusing, he thought % respondents meant the % of people who responded to the overall survey, not those who responded positively to the question. 
 -Second Image: Suggested using stick figures to compare sizes of each group.  Found the coloring confusing "I couldn't tell which color went with which pie piece."  Suggested changing title from "More than 2 in 5" to Nearly 40%.
 - Third Image: Number is too big and should be more integrated with the sentence.
 - Fourth Image: Change the word problem to concern because the visulaization is looking at confidnec not ability.
 - Fifth Image: Nothing to change
 - Overall: For the call to action, rephase  to pass relief bill that targets young people.  
 
### 22-Year Old Male Chemical Engineering Student:
-First Image: "I like the titel on the graph, it's helpful. Perhaps that could be the title for the section overall." No labels on the axis is confusing.  Adding a verticle line where the pandemic began would be helpful.
- Second Image: Could you make the chart out of food?  Found the colors confusing.
-Third Image:  Could you add a more interesting graphic? Not really sure why this was included.
- Fourth Image: Doesn't like the term wavering.  Seems like title is painting it worse than actually is since 85% of people are either high confidence or moderate confidence.
-Fifth Image: A little clunky, would expect the line to be increasing.  This lacks the punch that you would want as the last image.  Is there data pre march 2020 you could add?
-Overall: Tie in anxiety and causes more in the opening and closing.  Add statistics on homelessness and pre-covid.

### 50-Year Old Female Systems Analyst:
- First Image: Missing axis title caused confusion. Maybe say 4 in 10 rather than 2 in 5, or 40%.  Didn't realize the comparision to the national average until it was pointed out.  Get rid of the 30-39 year olds, because it causes confusion.
- Second Image: Could you replace enough food with food insecurity or satesfactory food?  Don't like the bar graph, find it confusing. Better label the sections.
- Third Image: Curious to know how many are usually behind on rent.  Is this significant?
- Fourth Image: Call out the 34% better.  Too many words in the title.  Why is payment deferred included?
- Fifth Image: Title is confusing and has too many words.  Need Axis titles.  Change veritcle axis length.  Change title to say percentage.
- Overall: Add something about reaching out to your friends if you are feeling fine.


# Changes Base on Findings
Overall I found the inut from my interviews to be exptremely helpful.  The main takeaway I have is that many of my graphs are not as clear as I thought they were.  While I was trying to create discriptive titles, in many cases they only cause more confusion or counfound the the point I am trying to make.  With that in mind I plan on abriviating the titles to all my visualizations.  Especially for Image one, I plan on replacing 2 in 5 with 40%.  Additionally, I need to adjust some of the axis titles to make sure it is clear what the graphs are showing.

I also plan on adjusting the first image to highlight the increase in anxiety in the last couple of weeks.  It had been my hope to show with this graph just how much higher the anxiety rate is for young adults than the national average, but that wasn't really getting across to my audience.  I think perhaps a bar graph would be more effective here.  

I  need to reevaluate my color choices.  They caused confusion in a few different places.  I am hoping that it will be easier to tell the colors apart when I make the graphs on the computer compared with just drawing it.  But this exercise reminded me of the importance of color in the images.

I  plan on finding ways to emphasize that this data if four 18-29 year olds without saying that in every graph.  Along with fixing some errors that my interviewees found.
