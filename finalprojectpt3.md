## Final Data Story 
[Part III Shorthand Presentation](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/gealy-final/index.html)

The main change I made between Parts II and III of my project was a re-odering of the story.  As I was doing my user research I realized that my final visualization was the least exciting and I also felt like I was reaching a bit with the statements that I was planning on making.  So instead I moved the part about mental illness to the end of the presentation in order to end on a more significant figure.

I also updated the titles of my graphs to better reflect what they were showing and to aliviate some of the confusion I was seeing in my user research.  I hope that by doing so I was able to make a clear picture.  

Finally, I updated my mental health visualization to include information about mental health prior to Covid-19.  I found during my research that people wanted more contextualization of the information.  In the other graphs I tried to add context through text around the graph, but I felt the mental health graph would be a good place to add a comparison to pre-covid times
