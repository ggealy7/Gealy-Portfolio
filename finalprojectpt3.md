## Final Data Story 
[Part III Shorthand Presentation](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/gealy-final/index.html)

My audience for my final project is the general public/ young adults.  With this in mind, the main change I made between Parts II and III of my project was a re-odering of the story.  As I was doing my user research I realized that my final visualization was the least exciting and I also felt like I was reaching a bit with the statements that I was planning on making.  So instead I moved the part about mental illness to the end of the presentation in order to end on a more significant figure.

I also updated the titles of my graphs to better reflect what they were showing and to aliviate some of the confusion I was seeing in my user research.  I hope that by doing so I was able to make a clear picture.  

Finally, I updated my mental health visualization to include information about mental health prior to Covid-19.  I found during my research that people wanted more contextualization of the information.  In the other graphs I tried to add context through text around the graph, but I felt the mental health graph would be a good place to add a comparison to pre-covid times

For the desing of my project I wanted to stick with cool colors and photos.  I looked around at what other mental health articles looked like and noticed that many use blue in their publications.  I decided to stick with blue for the color theme of my project.  

I also wanted to add pictures as a way to break up the test in my final presentation.  Prior to adding the scrolling pictures I found the presentaion not super engaging and awckard to go through.
