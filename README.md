# About Me
Hello! My name is Grace Gealy and I use she/her pronouns. I am a second year MSPPM student in the Telling Stories with Data course.  I'm from a small town in north-western PA, but Pittsburgh has been my home for the last 6 years.  When not in school I love to cook and hang out with my cat Aethy (pictured below).  After graduating I hope to work in local government.

# What I hope to learn
In this class I hope to learn how to create rich and easy to understand graphics.  I think that data is such a valuable tool, and I look forward to improving my ability to convey data effectively.
