This graphic shows the trends in the gross debt of a government as a percentage of GDP for OECD countries. Many countries saw an increase in this raio in 2008.

European countries do not have a consistant trend in their general debt to GDP  ratio.  However, Spain and Portugal have increased this ration almost in tandem, and the difference between the numbers remain at a simliar level.

The data for each visualization comes from the same souce and can her found [here](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm).  The data show the difference over time for OECD countries general debt in relation to their GDP.  This is typically thought of as a indicator of ["the sustainability of government finance"](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm).  Because the data shows a series of changes over time, I found the most easily understood visual method of the ones above to the the line graphs.  The bar graph from the OEECD website is a good tool when comparing single year numbers, especially when you are intested in rankings.  I found the grid of line charts were difficult to make comparisons between countries and make any assumptions about overall trends in the data.  I choose to make a line chart for the third visualisation because I think it is an intuitive way to make comparisions between two countries.  I highlighted Spain and Portugal because they had similar treands. I included the other European countries to illustrate that this trend was not a Europe wide trend, but seems to be containted to the Iberian Peninsula.
