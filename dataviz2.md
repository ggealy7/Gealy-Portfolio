This graphic shows the trends in the gross debt of a government as a percentage of GDP for OECD countries. Many countries saw an increase in this raio in 2008.

European countries do not have a consistant trend in their general debt to GDP  ratio.  However, Spain and Portugal have increased this ration almost in tandem, and the difference between the numbers remain at a simliar level.

The data for each visualization comes from the same source and can her found [here](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm).  The data show the difference over time for OECD countries general debt in relation to their GDP.  This is typically thought of as a indicator of ["the sustainability of government finance."](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)  Because the data shows a series of changes over time, I found the most easily understood visual method of the ones above to the the line graphs.  The bar graph from the OEECD website is a good tool when comparing single year numbers, especially when you are interested in rankings.  I found the grid of line charts were difficult to make comparisons between countries and make any assumptions about overall trends in the data.  

I chose to make a line chart for the third visualization because I think it is an intuitive way to make comparisons between two countries.  I highlighted Spain and Portugal because they had similar trends in their debt ratio with respect to the 2008 debt crisis. I included the other European countries to illustrate that this trend was not a Europe wide trend but seems to be contained to the Iberian Peninsula. One difficulty I had in making this type of chart was that I had to restructure the data so that each country had itâ€™s own column.  Without this restructuring, I was not able to highlight just a single country in a different color.  Of the three data visualizations, I find the final line chart most pleasing to look at.  It is particularly effective if you are only concerned with highlighting a few of the countries.
